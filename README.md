BadgerVision

## What does your app do?
People who suffer from alexithymia have difficulty identifying emotions in others. And people who struggle with prosopagnosia (face blindness) have difficulty recognizing faces. We are planning on building a 2 part app to help people recognize emotions and track faces.

1) The app will leverage facial recognition technology to identify unique faces. Each time a unique face comes into focus, it will generate a tone. Thus whenever the individual sees a repeated face, the same tone will be generated to help in their recognition.

2) The app will also leverage computer vision to identify emotions. The app will name the emotions that it detects in the faces of people in view.
